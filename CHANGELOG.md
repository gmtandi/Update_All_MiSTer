## Version 2.4 - 2025-10-17

### Added
- New Timeline feature, which allows users to see a chronological list of updates applied to their MiSTer.
- Timeline is included in the log viewer screen. It can be disabled in the Patrons menu or by adding `!update_all_timeline` to the custom filters.
- Timeline is also added as a standalone script, "update_all_timeline", which can be selected in the Scripts menu. This script can also be removed by adding `!update_all_timeline` to the custom filters.

### Changed

- Various fixes and improvements on the Log Viewer. It now works in different resolutions without flickering.

- Removed wait line for reading option, as the log viewer removes any need for human reading waits.
- Removed "Bad Apple DB" gimmick from the Patrons menu. You may still see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp8AGtR_p5w or run it manually by setting an empty `downloader.ini` with:
```ini
   [bad_apple_db]
   db_url = https://github.com/theypsilon/BadAppleDB_MiSTer/releases/download/v1/bad_apple_full_res_db.json.zip
   #db_url = https://github.com/theypsilon/BadAppleDB_MiSTer/releases/download/v1/bad_apple_half_res_db.json.zip
```

## Version 2.3.1 - 2025-06-06

### Added
- Updated Arcade Organizer [documentation](docs/arcade_organizer.md) within the new `docs/` folder and linked it in the [README.md](README.md).
- Update All DB now also updates the launcher `downloader.sh`.

### Changed
- Update All now runs Downloader through the new `downloader_bin` when is present in the system.
- Using a more precise time function to avoid spurious time errors (time.monotonic).
- Using the BIOS DB from ajgowans instead.

- Increased the reboot wait time to 5 seconds from 3 after a firmware update has been detected.

### Removed

## Version 2.3 - 2025-05-16

### Added
- Built-in Log Viewer screen which shows at the end of the run. You may use it to scroll up and down through the run output. It can be disabled but is on by default.

- Fixed a bug that prevented saving some internal system settings after changing them in the Settings Screen.
- Reduced the amount of wait before rebooting the system after a system file has been updated or installed.

- Fixed a number Arcade Organizer bugs, such as deprecated function calls, os.scandir errors, and other minor issues.
- Improvements in workflows, typing, and other minor fixes.

### Removed

## Version 2.2 - 2025-03-28

### Added
- Added update_all_mister database, which contains Update All files to improve the self-update process and enable more utilities to be installed in the future.
- Arcade Organizer is now part of Update All codebase, which improves execution speed, fixes bugs and simplifies maintenance. As result, the Arcade Organizer log now appears in update_all.log.
- New option to enable the distribution_main alternative database from Aitor Gómez which contains his custom version of the firmware (PR by Aitor Gómez).
- It is now possible to install Update All without remote code execution. The new section in the [README.md](README.md#how-to-avoid-executing-remote-code-altogether) shows how to do it.
- Added Patreon shoutout line that prints the supporter of the day at the end of the run.

### Changes
- The new update_all_mister database will be appended to downloader.ini automatically.
- The Arcade Organizer is now using to the new official [ArcadeDatabase](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ArcadeDatabase_MiSTer) for the metadata, which is a direct continuation of the work done by Toya, and still maintained by him.
- The downloader log is now correctly written to update_all.log, along with the rest of Update All's output.
- The launcher has been changed:
  - It now takes certificates installed by the distribution_mister database, substantially reducing the possibility of certificate problems.
  - It now runs update_all build faster by avoiding network checks when the build file `update_all.pyz` is present.
- When present, the build file from Downloader `downloader_latest.zip` is used instead of fetching it from the network.
- Optimized build process, which now uses less space and is faster to unzip and run.
- The initial output lines of Update All have been optimized by eliminating some unnecessary waits, resulting in a quicker startup.
- The local store of Update All is now saved in a JSON file instead of a ZIP, making loading and saving processes much faster.

### Added
- **Downloader support**. Main cores, JT cores, LLAPI cores, and Unofficial cores can be installed now using the new [MiSTer Downloader](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Downloader_MiSTer/). New users or old users of *Update All* without custom setups (non-default options at `update.ini`, `update_unofficials.ini`, `update_llapi.ini` or `update_jtcores.ini`, except `DOWNLOAD_BETA_CORES` which doesn't count) will have it activated by default. Old users with custom setups may activate it through the Misc menu, like shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DgLUXY3jvU). Keep in mind though, that your custom options will not be considered by the new Downloader, and everything will be installed at `/media/fat` by now.
- **Arcade Organizer 2.0**. Arcade Organizer changelog is [here](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). The Settings Screen offers a new Arcade Organizer menu that allows you to change many of the new options from the 2.0 version.
- **Arcade Offset**. Patched MRA files maintained by Atrac17. Check its [repository](https://github.com/atrac17/Arcade_Offset) for more info.
